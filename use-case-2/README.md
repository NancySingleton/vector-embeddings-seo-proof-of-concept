# Purpose

This project is for comparing a list of "required" items against a list of "existing" items, to find the closest matches that already exist.

# Usage

- Populate the `existing.csv` and `required.csv` files. Each item should be on a new line.
- Run `python3 -m use-case-2.find_matches` from the top level of the project.
- The `best_existing_match_by_required_item.csv` file will be populated.

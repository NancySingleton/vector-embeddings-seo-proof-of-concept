It may be useful to manually send a request to Open AI to calculate an embedding for a particular bit of text. The `embed-text.http` file contains a sample request to do this.

You will need:
- An Open AI API key
- The text you want to embed

Replace the placeholders in `embed-text.http` with this information.
